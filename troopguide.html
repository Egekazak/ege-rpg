        <h2>2. Key Definitions</h2>

        <h3>Knights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Landed nobles or vassals; symbols of chivalry and authority.</li>
          <li>Fight on horseback but often dismount by this era.</li>
          <li>Full plate or brigandine over mail, lance and sword, destrier or courser.</li>
          <li>Addressed as <b>“Ser.”</b> Only a few per noble house (2–5 typical).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Men-at-Arms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Paid professionals or retainers sworn to a lord.</li>
          <li>Former squires, lesser knights, or mercenaries.</li>
          <li>Equipped with halberds, poleaxes, or warhammers; brigandine or half-plate.</li>
          <li>The backbone of every serious retinue.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Footmen / Guards</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Permanent retainers of a keep or town; maintain order and defense.</li>
          <li>Padded jack or short mail, kettle helm, spear or bill.</li>
          <li>Distinct from levies — they are paid and drilled regularly.</li>
          <li><i>In RP: a manor or town might have 8–20 footmen total.</i></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Levies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Peasants raised temporarily for defense or war.</li>
          <li>Little or no training; minimal armor, farm tools adapted for battle.</li>
          <li>Return to their fields once the war ends.</li>
          <li><i>Never use levies as daily guards — they are seasonal troops.</i></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Archers & Crossbowmen</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Skilled commoners trained from youth.</li>
          <li>Longbowmen — disciplined and deadly at range.</li>
          <li>Crossbowmen — easier to train, slower to reload.</li>
          <li>Light armor; travel with pavises or stakes for cover.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
          <p><b>Clarification — Longbowmen:</b> Though common-born, longbowmen were elite specialists. In training and battlefield value, they stood <i>between skilled commoners and professionals</i>. In social rank, however, they remained yeomen, not knights. Place them at Tier III, but treat elite longbow companies as near-professional formations.</p>

        <h2>4. Common Mistakes in RP</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>❌ <b>Too many knights.</b> Knighthood was rare and symbolic.</li>
          <li>❌ <b>Over-armored peasants.</b> Mail and plate were costly; commoners wore padded jacks.</li>
          <li>❌ <b>Mixing guards and soldiers.</b> Guards keep order; soldiers fight wars.</li>
          <li>❌ <b>Standing armies everywhere.</b> Only major realms or orders maintained permanent forces.</li>

        <h3>Interpretation for RP</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Personal Retinue:</b> Even great lords rarely had more than 200–300 men permanently in pay.</li>
        <li><b>Feudal Muster:</b> Counts and dukes could call up 1000–2000 by summoning vassals and town militias.</li>
        <li><b>Temporary Nature:</b> Once a campaign ended, levies and vassal troops returned home.</li>
        <li><b>Command Hierarchy:</b> Each vassal led his own contingent under the count’s banner, forming the full host.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
        <p><b>Example — Aldenwall:</b> Count William Davenmoore could command roughly 150–200 professional retainers and knights, but when his vassal houses answer the call, his host swells to nearly 1000 men. This mirrors the structure of a 15th-century comital army and fits perfectly within historical ratios.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
        In short, a thousand men is the strength of a powerful but not royal house — a realistic upper limit for any count or regional lord in a low-fantasy setting.
