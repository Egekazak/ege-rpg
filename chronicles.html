        <div class="folio-meta">
          <p><i>From the writings of Brother Jan of Vyšehrad, winter 1403</i></p>
        </div>
        <div class="folio-text">
            <p>
                We found her on the corpse-road south of Olomouc, among the fallen from yesterday’s skirmish. The rain was fine as thread and turned the mud to wine around them. The air was thick with the stench of wet iron and trampled earth—blood turning sweet as it cooled.
            </p>
            <p>
                She sat on the broken axle of a cart, cleaning a fallen soldier’s hand, finger by finger, as though he might wake and thank her. The man’s eyes were open to the rain. She closed them when she was done.
            </p>
            <p>Marek said, <i>“He’ll not need prayers.”</i></p>
            <p>She looked up at him and smiled. <i>“Then I’ll keep the words.”</i></p>
            <p>Her dress had been white once; the cloth clung to her in torn ribbons, mud at the hem and a dark ring about her throat where rope had bitten. Rain slid from her skin as though it could find no purchase. In that gray light she was too young, too composed, and—God forgive me—too beautiful for the field we stood in. Her hair was long and brown, darkened by rain; her eyes were blue, too bright for the day. The smile never left her.</p>
            <p>She looked between us, then to the dead around her. <i>“Your colours are still whole,”</i> she said. <i>“Most of theirs are gone. Do you miss them—the men or the banners?”</i></p>
            <p>Marek frowned. <i>“Both rot the same in mud.”</i></p>
            <p><i>“Then you’re honest,”</i> she said, and rose. <i>“Where are you headed?”</i></p>
            <p><i>“Prague,”</i> Marek answered. <i>“If the road still leads there.”</i></p>
            <p><i>“Every road leads somewhere,”</i>she said.</p>
            <p>Marek’s hand tightened on his sword belt. <i>“Where does yours lead?”</i></p>
            <p>She smiled, not as one who had been caught in a question, but as though she’d heard a riddle answered. <i>“I suppose I’ll find out when you do.”</i></p>
            <p><i>"We’ve no room for strays,"</i> Marek said, and turned down the road. The air felt heavier for it. I cannot explain why, but it seemed a curse to leave her sitting there amid the fallen, a single living figure in the ruin. Perhaps I feared that if we left her, some part of us would stay behind to keep her company.</p>
            <p>I called to her before I understood why. <i>“Girl—come on then.”</i></p>
            <p>She rose, gathered her skirt, and followed us barefoot through the mire. When she passed, the rain seemed to hush a moment, as if uncertain of its duty.</p>
            <p>Marek grumbled, <i>“We’ll regret this.”</i></p>
            <p><i>“We already regret so many things,”</i> I said. <i>“One more won't matter.”</i></p>
            <p>She then spoke, softly. <i>“Regret is how God remembers us.”</i></p>
            <p>Marek gave a low laugh. <i>“Then He must remember me well,”</i> he said.</p>
            <p>I didn’t answer, but I found myself agreeing.</p>
            <p>We walked on in silence. The road bent west, the light fading to ash. By the time we found shelter beneath a ruined mill, the rain had turned to mist and clung to everything we owned. She followed without a word, and we let her.</p>
            <p>I write these words while the fire gutters low. She sleeps across from us, if sleep it is. The rope mark showed clear, no bruise nor welt—only the memory of one. I did not tell him what I saw: that her shadow lingered a breath longer than the firelight allowed.</p>
            <p>I think it would still have been a curse to leave her.</p>

        <h3>◇ Folio II — The Names at the Fire</h3>
        <div class="folio-meta">
          <p><i>From the writings of Brother Jan of Vyšehrad, winter 1403</i></p>
        </div>
        <div class="folio-text">
        <p>The rain eased toward midnight. We found shelter beneath what was left of a mill, its wheel broken and sunk in the mud. Marek struck flint while I gathered roots and bark dry enough to burn. She said nothing, only held her hands out when the flame caught, as if the light were an old acquaintance.</p>
        <p><i>“Got a name?”</i> Marek asked once the fire steadied.</p>
        <p><i>“Izolda.”</i> She spoke it plainly, as though testing whether we would believe her.</p>
        <p><i>“A noble name for the road,”</i> I said.</p>
        <p><i>“It was given to me by someone who thought I was better than I am,”</i> she answered.</p>
        <p>I noticed the mark at her throat again and decided to ask what it was.</p>
        <p>She touched it lightly, as if surprised to find it still there. <i>“A reminder to breathe,”</i> she said, and left it at that.</p>
        <p>I was not sure what to make of it, but decided not to press further.</p>
        <p>Marek raised an eyebrow and studied her for a moment. <i>“Looks more like the mark of someone who escaped a sentence,”</i> he said.</p>
        <p><i>“We’ve no right to question it,”</i> I told him. <i>“We’re marked men ourselves.”</i></p>
        <p>He only shrugged. From his look I guessed he agreed and was content to let the matter rest. He then poured wine into three dented cups. She took hers but did not drink.</p>
        <p><i>“If you’ve travelled long enough,”</i> I told her, <i>“you learn to bless the taste of anything that isn’t rain.”</i></p>
        <p><i>“And if you’ve travelled longer?”</i> she asked.</p>
        <p><i>“Then you drink to forget.”</i></p>
        <p>Marek raised his cup. <i>“To forgetting, then.”</i></p>
        <p>She smiled faintly.</p>
        <p>The fire hissed and threw its light across her face. She watched the sparks drift upward as if counting them, then whispered, <i>“They look like souls that forgot which way was heaven.”</i></p>
        <p>Marek handed me the wineskin. <i>“Your kind of sermon, Brother.”</i></p>
        <p><i>“I’ve heard worse in Prague,”</i> I said.</p>
        <p>She laughed quietly, the sound low and clean, as if cut from glass. <i>“Then write it down. Write us saints, Brother.”</i></p>
        <p>Marek grunted. <i>“Saints don’t drink.”</i></p>
        <p><i>“Then write us thirsty ones.”</i></p>
        <p>I laughed again before I meant to. It’s easier to believe in God when she talks of Him like that.</p>
        <p>She watched me for a while, the faintest smile still on her lips. <i>“And what about you two?”</i> she asked. <i>“You ask names but give none.”</i></p>
        <p><i>“Jan,”</i> I said. <i>“Last I fought the Turks at Nicopolis. Barely escaped.”</i> I touched the old wound at my leg; the cold makes it ache. <i>“Now I’m bound for Prague. I’d sooner fight with ink than steel, if the city still has room for another scholar.”</i></p>
        <p>Marek tipped his cup toward her. <i>“Marek. I fought for Wenceslaus — until his brother came for his crown and left us in the mud. A man can still sell his sword in the city, if he’s not too proud.”</i></p>
        <p>She nodded as if the answers pleased her.</p>
        <p>For a while no one spoke. Marek cleaned his sword in silence; I sharpened my quill. She kept counting the sparks, her lips moving softly, her long brown hair falling forward to frame her face. There was a stillness about her that drew the eye and unsettled the heart. She was hauntingly beautiful.</p>
        <p>Then she began to hum — a slow, fragile tune that carried just above the crackle of the fire. It might have been a lullaby once. The melody and words were foreign to my ear; I thought it German, though I could not place it. At first Marek watched her warily, hand resting on his sword belt, but as the tune went on his shoulders eased. By the end he was leaning back against his pack, eyes half closed, as if the sound had stolen the weight from him. </p>
        <p>The fire sank low, and the humming faded with it. I think that was the first night I wrote her name.</p>
