        <h3>◇ Folio I — The Woman by the Road</h3>
        <div class="folio-meta">
          <p><i>From the writings of Brother Jan of Vyšehrad, autumn 1403</i></p>
        </div>
        <div class="folio-text">
            <p>
                We found her on the corpse-road past Rosice, among the fallen from yesterday’s skirmish. The rain was fine as thread and turned the mud to wine around them. The air was thick with the stench of wet iron and trampled earth—blood turning sweet as it cooled.
            </p>
            <p>
                She sat on the broken axle of a cart, cleaning a fallen soldier’s hand, finger by finger, as though he might wake and thank her. The man’s eyes were open to the rain. She closed them when she was done.
            </p>
            <p>Marek said, <i>“He’ll not need prayers.”</i></p>
            <p>She looked up at him and smiled. <i>“Then I’ll keep the words.”</i></p>
            <p>Her dress had been white once; the cloth clung to her in torn ribbons, mud at the hem and a dark ring about her throat where rope had bitten. Rain slid from her skin as though it could find no purchase. In that gray light she was too young, too composed, and—God forgive me—too beautiful for the field we stood in. Her hair was long and brown, darkened by rain; her eyes were blue, too bright for the day. The smile never left her.</p>
            <p>She looked between us, then to the dead around her. <i>“Your colours are still whole,”</i> she said. <i>“Most of theirs are gone. Do you miss them—the men or the banners?”</i></p>
            <p>Marek frowned. <i>“Both rot the same in mud.”</i></p>
            <p><i>“Then you’re honest,”</i> she said, and rose. <i>“Where are you headed?”</i></p>
            <p><i>“Prague,”</i> Marek answered. <i>“If the road still leads there.”</i></p>
            <p><i>“Every road leads somewhere,”</i> she said.</p>
            <p>Marek’s hand tightened on his sword belt. <i>“Where does yours lead?”</i></p>
            <p>She smiled, not as one who had been caught in a question, but as though she’d heard a riddle answered. <i>“I suppose I’ll find out when you do.”</i></p>
            <p><i>"We’ve no room for strays,"</i> Marek said, and turned down the road. The air felt heavier for it. I cannot explain why, but it seemed a curse to leave her sitting there amid the fallen, a single living figure in the ruin. Perhaps I feared that if we left her, some part of us would stay behind to keep her company.</p>
            <p>I called to her before I understood why. <i>“Girl—come on then.”</i></p>
            <p>She rose, gathered her skirt, and followed us barefoot through the mire. When she passed, the rain seemed to hush a moment, as if uncertain of its duty.</p>
            <p>Marek grumbled, <i>“We’ll regret this.”</i></p>
            <p><i>“We already regret so many things,”</i> I said. <i>“One more won't matter.”</i></p>
            <p>She then spoke, softly. <i>“Regret is how God remembers us.”</i></p>
            <p>Marek gave a low laugh. <i>“Then He must remember me well,”</i> he said.</p>
            <p>I didn’t answer, but I found myself agreeing.</p>
            <p>We walked on in silence. The road bent west, the light fading to ash. By the time we found shelter beneath a ruined mill, the rain had turned to mist and clung to everything we owned. She followed without a word, and we let her.</p>
            <p>I write these words while the fire gutters low. She sleeps across from us, if sleep it is. The rope mark showed clear, no bruise nor welt—only the memory of one. I did not tell him what I saw: that her shadow lingered a breath longer than the firelight allowed.</p>
            <p>I think it would still have been a curse to leave her.</p>

        <h3>◇ Folio II — The Names at the Fire</h3>
        <div class="folio-meta">
          <p><i>From the writings of Brother Jan of Vyšehrad, autumn 1403</i></p>
        </div>
        <div class="folio-text">
        <p>The rain eased toward midnight. We found shelter beneath what was left of a mill, its wheel broken and sunk in the mud. Marek struck flint while I gathered roots and bark dry enough to burn. She said nothing, only held her hands out when the flame caught, as if the light were an old acquaintance.</p>
        <p><i>“Got a name?”</i> Marek asked once the fire steadied.</p>
        <p><i>“Izolda.”</i> She spoke it plainly, as though testing whether we would believe her.</p>
        <p><i>“A noble name for the road,”</i> I said.</p>
        <p><i>“It was given to me by someone who thought I was better than I am,”</i> she answered.</p>
        <p>I noticed the mark at her throat again and decided to ask what it was.</p>
        <p>She touched it lightly, as if surprised to find it still there. <i>“A reminder to breathe,”</i> she said, and left it at that.</p>
        <p>I was not sure what to make of it, but decided not to press further.</p>
        <p>Marek raised an eyebrow and studied her for a moment. <i>“Looks more like the mark of someone who escaped a sentence,”</i> he said.</p>
        <p><i>“We’ve no right to question it,”</i> I told him. <i>“We’re marked men ourselves.”</i></p>
        <p>He only shrugged. From his look I guessed he agreed and was content to let the matter rest. He then poured wine into three dented cups. She took hers but did not drink.</p>
        <p><i>“If you’ve travelled long enough,”</i> I told her, <i>“you learn to bless the taste of anything that isn’t rain.”</i></p>
        <p><i>“And if you’ve travelled longer?”</i> she asked.</p>
        <p><i>“Then you drink to forget.”</i></p>
        <p>Marek raised his cup. <i>“To forgetting, then.”</i></p>
        <p>She smiled faintly.</p>
        <p>The fire hissed and threw its light across her face. She watched the sparks drift upward as if counting them, then whispered, <i>“They look like souls that forgot which way was heaven.”</i></p>
        <p>Marek handed me the wineskin. <i>“Your kind of sermon, Brother.”</i></p>
        <p><i>“I’ve heard worse in Prague,”</i> I said.</p>
        <p>She laughed quietly, the sound low and clean, as if cut from glass. <i>“Then write it down. Write us saints, Brother.”</i></p>
        <p>Marek grunted. <i>“Saints don’t drink.”</i></p>
        <p><i>“Then write us thirsty ones.”</i></p>
        <p>I laughed again before I meant to. It’s easier to believe in God when she talks of Him like that.</p>
        <p>She watched me for a while, the faintest smile still on her lips. <i>“And what about you two?”</i> she asked. <i>“You ask names but give none.”</i></p>
        <p><i>“Jan,”</i> I said. <i>“Last I fought the Turks at Nicopolis. Barely escaped.”</i> I touched the old wound at my leg; the cold makes it ache. <i>“Now I’m bound for Prague. I’d sooner fight with ink than steel, if the city still has room for another scholar.”</i></p>
        <p>Marek tipped his cup toward her. <i>“Marek. I fought for Wenceslaus — until his brother came for his crown and left us in the mud. A man can still sell his sword in the city, if he’s not too proud.”</i></p>
        <p>She nodded as if the answers pleased her.</p>
        <p>For a while no one spoke. Marek cleaned his sword in silence; I sharpened my quill. She kept counting the sparks, her lips moving softly, her long brown hair falling forward to frame her face. There was a stillness about her that drew the eye and unsettled the heart. She was hauntingly beautiful.</p>
        <p>Then she began to hum — a slow, fragile tune that carried just above the crackle of the fire. It might have been a lullaby once. The melody and words were foreign to my ear; I thought it German, though I could not place it. At first Marek watched her warily, hand resting on his sword belt, but as the tune went on his shoulders eased. By the end he was leaning back against his pack, eyes half closed, as if the sound had stolen the weight from him. </p>
        <p>The fire sank low, and the humming faded with it. I think that was the first night I wrote her name.</p>

        <h3>◇ Folio III — The Road West</h3>
        <div class="folio-meta">
          <p><i>From the writings of Brother Jan of Vyšehrad, autumn 1403</i></p>
        </div>
        <div class="folio-text">
          <p>
            Dawn came pale and brittle. The fire had gone out sometime before first light, and the air stung with cold. We walked west, following the trade road toward Náměšť. The land here was good once — black soil, low hills, birch and alder — but the fields were bare, the huts half–burned. Smoke still hung in the hollows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Near noon we passed a woman drawing water from a well. She crossed herself when she saw us, but her eyes lingered on Izolda. She whispered something, but it was inaudible. Izolda only smiled, and the woman dropped her bucket and fled inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>“They think every stray is a spirit these days,”</i> Marek muttered. <i>“Too many dead to tell the difference.”</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>“Perhaps they’re right,”</i> I said, though I meant it kindly.
          </p>
          <p>
            We ate by the roadside, bread gone hard, wine gone thin. Izolda sat apart, watching the crows move in the furrows. She hummed again, the same tune as the night before. In daylight it sounded smaller, almost human. A farmer’s child stopped his cart to listen, then crossed himself twice before driving on.
          </p>
          <p>
            I caught myself watching her then — the way the cold seemed to forget her skin, the way her hair caught the light though the day was gray. It shamed me, that impulse. Not desire, but something older: the ache of seeing grace in a place that had none. Perhaps that is the sin of men like me — to seek God’s reflection in what is only human.
          </p>
          <p>
            By evening the road bent through a stretch of birchwood. My leg ached from the old wound. She walked between us, light as wind over snow. When I asked if she was cold, she said she had been colder once, but could not remember when.
          </p>
          <p>
            That night we reached an abandoned chapel on a hill. The roof was gone but the altar still stood, slick with moss and rain. She laid her hands upon it as though greeting an old friend. Marek swore softly and went to make camp outside. I stayed a moment longer. The light through the broken roof fell across her hair like a benediction, and for an instant — I swear it — I thought the ruin breathed.

        <h3>◇ Folio IV — The Road of the Dead</h3>
        <div class="folio-meta">
          <p><i>From the writings of Brother Jan of Vyšehrad, autumn 1403</i></p>
        </div>
        <div class="folio-text">
        <p>
          The road west was full of the dead. We met them before noon — bodies heaped on a wagon, two peasants driving the oxen through the slush. They said a skirmish had passed three days prior; they were carting what was left to the fields beyond the river.
        </p>
        <p>
          Izolda went to them without a word. She helped lift the fallen, closed eyes, untangled limbs. I told her not to touch them, but she did not listen. Her hands moved with a care I had forgotten belonged to the living. Marek watched, expressionless, until one of the men crossed himself and muttered that she should be left alone with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we walked again, the crows followed. She smelled of smoke and rain.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>“You give too much to the dead,”</i> I told her.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>“They’re easier to help,”</i> she said.
        </p>
        <p>
          By dusk we reached a village crouched around a small green, its wells boarded, its church leaning like a drunk. Smoke rose from a few chimneys but no sound came from the yards. The people watched from behind fences, eyes hollow with suspicion.
        </p>
        <p>
          A priest came out first — old, thin, with his stole worn to threads. <i>“You bring her here?”</i> he shouted. <i>“Back from the gallows? God have mercy, you bring her here again?”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>“We’ve never been here,”</i> Marek said, his hand resting on the hilt of his longsword.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>“She has,”</i> the priest spat. <i>“I saw her hang with my own eyes. Witch, consorter, blasphemer. Look! The mark still shows.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Izolda stood calm as stone. <i>“If you hung me,”</i> she said, <i>“you did it badly.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The crowd stirred; a stone struck the mud at her feet. Another man came forward with a hoe. Marek moved between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>“Back off,”</i> he warned. <i>“You’ll find no miracle worth dying for.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The priest raised his cross, shouting a prayer that cracked his voice. Then the men rushed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marek’s blade moved first — one clean stroke, another, the sound of iron through cloth. No wasted motion, only the solid rhythm of a trained man. I joined him without thinking; the hammer swung of its own memory. The spike found a chest, the flat caught a jaw. It was over in heartbeats. I remembered the weight, the recoil, the sudden quiet that always follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          One villager lay in the dirt, chest split open like wet bark. The rest fell back, dragging the priest with them, the women screaming from the doorways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marek wiped his sword on his red surcoat. <i>“Idiots,”</i> he said. <i>“They came at steel with farm tools.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>“They thought they were defending God,”</i> I said.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>“Then He armed them poorly,”</i> Marek grunted.
        </p>
        <p>
          We left before they could find courage again. Night was approaching, and the road darkened ahead. None of us spoke until the village lights had vanished behind the trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          We made camp by the river. The fire smoked but held. Marek sat sharpening his blade; I cleaned the hammer’s face and spike. Izolda watched us both as if weighing which of us was more dangerous.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>“A waste of men,”</i> Marek said. <i>“But better them than us.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>“Every road has its toll,”</i> I answered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Izolda looked into the flame. <i>“And some pay twice.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          None of us spoke for a long while. The fire crackled, the river whispered beyond the dark. Then, so softly I almost thought I imagined it, she said, <i>“Thank you.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Marek only nodded. I could not. I watched the fire burn low and wondered which of us she meant. The ink thickens in the cold tonight; I write slower than I should.

        <h3>◇ Folio V — The Bridge of Náměšť</h3>
        <div class="folio-meta">
          <p><i>From the writings of Brother Jan of Vyšehrad, autumn 1403</i></p>
        </div>
        <div class="folio-text">
        <p>
          The hills opened toward evening and the river lay below, wide and dull beneath a rim of yellowed reeds. Beyond it stood the keep of Náměšť. Marek saw it first and said, <i>“There might still be men who remember their oaths.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew the garrison and their sergeant, and the gate was opened after only a few words. Soldiers are quick to trust a man who smells of rain and iron; blood speaks plainer than heraldry. I have often thought there is more honour among strangers who have bled together than among families that share a hearth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside, the hall was loud with men and smoke. Marek traded rough greetings, and a debt was repaid with bread, soup, and a corner near the fire. The sergeant’s eyes lingered on Izolda.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>“Where’d you find that one?”</i> he asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>“Near Rosice,”</i> Marek said. <i>“A stray.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The sergeant grinned. <i>“A stray? Looks more like a lord’s daughter stolen for company.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I told him to mind his tongue, but Marek was quicker.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>“We’re killers, Sergeant, not monsters,”</i> he said. <i>“She walks with us because she wills it. If she wished to leave, she’d be gone already.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The laughter at the tables dulled after that. No one pressed the matter again.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sergeant cleared his throat and leaned closer. <i>“You should know, the lord’s grown weary. Sigismund’s men press harder every month. Wenceslaus no longer holds these lands— and the keep won’t risk sheltering strangers when the red banners of Buda reach the valley. Best you don’t stay long.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Marek nodded once. <i>“We won't.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          While they drank, I wrote. The warmth felt borrowed. I have served the Church most of my life — in chapels and on battlefields — yet the girl speaks of God as one who has seen Him and found Him wanting. Her words return to me when I try to pray, clear as bells through fog. Perhaps faith, like wine, spoils when kept too long.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marek came from the armoury with a small dagger and placed it beside her. <i>“For the road,”</i> he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>“I won’t need it,”</i> she answered.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>“You will,”</i> he said. <i>“There are worse men than me and the priest.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          She smiled. <i>“You’re not bad men.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Marek shrugged. <i>“Don’t test the point.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          She laughed once, softly.

          I thought then of the village we left behind—the priest’s face, the stones, the fear. I am glad they did not take her, though I still wonder what sin or sorrow made them hate her so. No lie travels so far as the one men tell in God’s name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worse still are those who listen too well—the peasants who drink every word of damnation until it sours their souls, who make a pyre of their neighbor’s grief and call it piety. In such hands, faith becomes a cudgel, and mercy the first to burn.
        </p>
        <p>
          The words darkened as I wrote them, the ink bleeding wider than I meant. I felt her eyes before I saw them.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a moment she looked at me—truly looked—and the noise of the hall fell away. The firelight wavered between us, and for a heartbeat I forgot the sound of men and cups around the fire. Her gaze held mine until thought itself seemed to stumble. I could not tell if it was comfort or warning that kept me there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then she smiled and rose, the hem of her dress whispering over the rushes. <i>“What do you write about?”</i> she asked. It struck me then that she had never asked before.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hesitated. The words on the page were too close to her—too much of her. <i>“Our road,”</i> I said at last. <i>“Where we’ve been, what we’ve seen.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          She leaned closer, the fire catching her hair like copper thread. <i>“And me?”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>“You walk with us,”</i> I answered, though it sounded poor even as I said it. I wondered if she could read, and hoped she could not. But her eyes lingered on the parchment, and I knew she could. She said nothing more, only smiled again and went back to her place by the fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          I set down my quill before my hand betrayed what I dared not think.
