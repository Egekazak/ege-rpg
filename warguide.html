<p>Most lords and armies did everything they could to <b>avoid a real battle</b> — and with good reason. Between the big set-piece battles of the age, 99% of the fighting was a constant grind of <b>skirmishes</b>, <b>chevauchées</b>, <b>ambushes</b>, <b>raids</b>, and <b>siege actions</b> — the <i>true daily bread</i> of 14th–15th century war.</p>

<p>Most medieval soldiers <b>lived and died in these skirmishes.</b></p>

<p>What follows is a breakdown of how those skirmishes actually looked, felt, and functioned — <b>the rhythm of war that defined an entire age.</b></p>

<hr>

<h2>What “Skirmish” Really Meant (1300–1450)</h2>

<p>When chroniclers say “they met in a skirmish” (<i>conflixerunt in praelio modico</i>, <i>ein kleines Treffen</i>), it could mean anything from 50 to 1,000 men.</p>

<p><b>You can picture it:</b> scouts and foragers bumping into each other out on the road, a few shouted orders, arrows flying — not the tidy battle lines paintings love to show.</p>

<h3>A typical skirmish looked like this:</h3>
<ol>
  <li><b>Foraging or raiding force</b> (maybe 100–500 men) rides out to burn villages or capture supplies.</li>
  <li><b>Enemy scouts</b> spot them.</li>
  <li>A <b>response party</b> (local knights, sergeants, or militia) intercepts them.</li>
  <li>A few hours of chaotic <b>mounted combat, dismounts, arrow volleys, and pursuit</b> follow.</li>
  <li>Both sides disengage when wounded or captives pile up — before things spiral into disaster.</li>
</ol>

<p>These fights might last <b>minutes to an hour</b>, with casualties often under a hundred — but reputations were made and lost in them.</p>

<blockquote>“A skirmish can cost a captain his company, or make his name feared for years.”</blockquote>
<h2>Skirmish Archetypes</h2>

<h3>1. Ambush in terrain</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dense forest, ravine, or narrow road.</li>
  <li>Scouts or vanguard trapped by concealed archers or crossbowmen.</li>
  <li>Short, violent, over within half an hour.<br><b>Example:</b> English longbow ambushes in Normandy, or Hussite wagon traps in Bohemia.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Chevauchée interception</h3>
<ul>
  <li>One side raids (burning villages, taking livestock).</li>
  <li>The other shadows them, trying to force a fight at a bridge or ford.</li>
  <li>Archers and light horse exchange missiles, then cavalry charge.<br><b>Example:</b> Hundred Years’ War — the Black Prince’s raids through France, harassed constantly by French companies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Castle harassment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Defenders sally out when besiegers get careless.</li>
  <li>Short cavalry sortie to destroy siege engines or kill engineers.</li>
  <li>The besiegers rally, push them back inside.<br><b>Example:</b> Standard around every 14th c. fortress siege; endlessly repeated.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Pitched patrol clash</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Both sides’ vanguards meet by accident while scouting.</li>
  <li>Neither wants a full battle; both deploy small tactical formations.</li>
  <li>Archers and crossbows open; cavalry probe flanks; then withdrawal.<br><b>Example:</b> On the eve of big battles like Poitiers or Agincourt, these encounters decided where and when the real fight would occur.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Looked in Action</h2>

<blockquote>“Here’s how such a meeting of arms might unfold — a slice of war as it truly was.”</blockquote>

<p>Imagine a small plain between two villages in 1405:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>50 mounted men-at-arms</b>, 80 <b>crossbowmen</b>, and <b>20 light horse</b> ride out under a banner.</li>
  <li>Opposing them, maybe <b>60 mounted men</b>, mostly local retainers and hired riders.</li>
  <li>Both deploy quickly — no grand speeches, no formations.</li>
  <li>Crossbow volleys crack; horses scream; a few riders charge and collide.</li>
  <li>Once one side’s captain is unhorsed or captured, morale breaks, and the rest scatter.</li>
  <li>Survivors flee into woods or back to camp.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Casualties:</b> perhaps 10 dead, 20 wounded, a handful captured for ransom.<br>
<b>Result:</b> both sides claim victory in their chronicles.</p>

<h2>Why Skirmishes Mattered More Than Battles</h2>

<table>
  <tr><th>Factor</th><th>Reason</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Economy</td><td>Armies fought to destroy harvests and ransack supply lines, not annihilate each other.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Ransom culture</td><td>Capturing nobles for money was more profitable than killing them.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Psychological warfare</td><td>Burning and raiding forced opponents to react or pay tribute.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Attrition</td><td>Skirmishes bled manpower and morale slowly without risking the whole army.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Politics</td><td>Lords preferred limited engagements — a lost skirmish wasn’t a catastrophe, a lost battle was.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>What Weapons and Tactics You’d See</h2>

<table>
  <tr><th>Troop Type</th><th>Typical Use in Skirmish</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Light Cavalry (hobelars, stradiots, prickers)</td><td>Fast raids, reconnaissance, harassment.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Archers / Crossbowmen</td><td>Open and close-range volleys; dismount and take cover behind wagons or hedges.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Men-at-arms</td><td>Act as anchors or shock troops, but often dismounted to fight on foot.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Handgonners (after 1380)</td><td>Small detachments for noise and panic — not decisive yet.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Pavise bearers / shieldmen</td><td>Protect shooters in narrow passes or near bridges.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>A skirmish was less about “winning” and more about <b>wearing down</b>, <b>delaying</b>, and <b>learning</b> — who’s camped where, how fast they can mobilize, which captain is bold or timid.</p>

<h2>The Nature of War</h2>

<blockquote>“Battles are rare. War is hunger, smoke, and rumor.”</blockquote>

<table>
  <tr><th>Concept</th><th>Reality</th><th>RP Angle</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Campaigns</td><td>Mostly marches, sieges, raids.</td><td>Use war as background noise — refugees, scorched earth, empty villages.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Battles</td><td>Decisive but exceptional.</td><td>Treat full battles as world-shifting events, not weekly encounters.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Mercenaries</td><td>Professional, contractual, and pragmatic.</td><td>PCs could serve in a company, defect, or form their own band.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Chivalry vs. Necessity</td><td>Nobles preached honor but fought dirty.</td><td>Show moral tension between ideals and survival.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Combat Philosophy</h2>

<blockquote>“Victory means living to burn their harvest next month.”</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><b>Avoid risk.</b> Commanders withdraw before full losses.</li>
  <li><b>Capture over kill.</b> Nobles worth ransom; commoners less so.</li>
  <li><b>Morale is everything.</b> Noise, fear, smoke, and weather break armies before blades do.</li>
  <li><b>Magic ≠ artillery.</b> Treat magic as force multipliers, not battlefield-ending nukes.</li>
  <li><b>Survival first.</b> Retreat, regroup, ransom, revenge — the cycle of war.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Life Between Battles</h2>

<table>
  <tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Realism</th><th>Roleplay Hooks</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Foraging</td><td>Armies live off the land; famine constant.</td><td>Starving villages, theft, uneasy alliances.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Camp life</td><td>Disease, gambling, desertion.</td><td>Character drama between skirmishes.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Command</td><td>Captains run their companies.</td><td>Chain-of-command politics and rivalries.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Sieges</td><td>Months-long. Disease kills more than arrows.</td><td>Use for slow-burn RP — diplomacy, sabotage, morale, logistics.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Magic & Myth in Realism</h2>

<p>Use magic <b>sparingly and consistently</b>, as if it were another military tool.</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>School</th><th>Grounded Military Role</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Alchemy</td><td>Gunpowder analogues: firepots, smoke, healing tonics.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Necromancy</td><td>Cheap labor and scouts; stigmatized but effective.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Divination</td><td>Reconnaissance and morale (omens, blessings).</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Illusion</td><td>Camouflage, confusion, or deception in fog and smoke.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Runic Enchantments</td><td>Incremental improvements: longer blade life, steadier aim.</td></tr>
</table>

<blockquote>“If magic replaces skill, it cheapens victory. If it enhances skill, it elevates heroes.”</blockquote>

<h2>Narrating Skirmishes</h2>

<p>Tips for DMs or storytellers:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Start in motion.</b> Players join mid-march or mid-ambush.</li>
  <li><b>Keep the scale intimate.</b> Emphasize confusion, noise, dust, shouting.</li>
  <li><b>Describe environment, not just weapons.</b> “The smell of trampled grass and sweat outweighs the sound of swords.”</li>
  <li><b>Reward tactical thinking.</b> Terrain, timing, morale, fatigue.</li>
  <li><b>Make retreat honorable.</b> The goal is <i>survival</i>, not glory.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Battle of Grunwald (1410)</h2>

<blockquote>“When banners met that day, the world held its breath.”</blockquote>

<p>While most of medieval war was fought in raids and sieges, there were moments when everything came to a head — when entire realms gambled their armies in a single day. The <b>Battle of Grunwald</b>, also known as <b>Tannenberg</b>, was one of those moments.</p>

<h3>The Combatants</h3>

<p>In July of 1410, the <b>Teutonic Order</b>, a crusading state of armored knights and mercenaries, faced the united forces of <b>Poland</b> and <b>Lithuania</b> under <b>King Władysław II Jagiełło</b> and <b>Grand Duke Vytautas</b>.</p>

<p>It was a war born of ambition, trade, and faith — the Order’s last attempt to dominate the Baltic and subdue its neighbors under the banner of a “Northern Crusade.”</p>

<p>Each side brought <b>tens of thousands</b> to the field: knights, men-at-arms, footmen, and banners from nearly every corner of Central Europe. Contemporary estimates speak of <b>50,000–60,000 soldiers</b>, making it one of the <b>largest battles of the Middle Ages</b> north of the Alps.</p>

<h3>Why It Was Exceptional</h3>

<table>
  <tr><th>Factor</th><th>Why It Stands Out</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Scale</td><td>Most medieval armies numbered in the hundreds or low thousands. Grunwald was tens of thousands.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Documentation</td><td>Chronicles, payrolls, and letters survive — we know the names of mercenary captains and even how many men they led.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Diversity</td><td>Germans, Poles, Lithuanians, Czechs, Hungarians, Tatars — a cross-section of Europe.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Duration</td><td>The battle raged for nearly half a day — unusually long for pre-gunpowder warfare.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Destruction</td><td>The Teutonic Order lost nearly its entire leadership. Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen was killed; hundreds of knights captured or slain.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Aftermath</td><td>The Order’s defeat marked the decline of the crusading ideal in Europe — the last time holy war and feudal ambition met on such a scale.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>The Cost of Glory</h3>

<p>Contemporary witnesses wrote of a field so littered with bodies that horses could not ride through. The sun baked the fallen in their armor; scavengers and carrion birds covered the plain for days. The victors, though triumphant, were too exhausted to press their advantage — their “victory” bled them dry.</p>

<blockquote>“One day of glory can cost a generation of strength.”</blockquote>

<p>The following months brought plague, famine, and bankrupt treasuries as ransoms and burials consumed the survivors’ spoils.</p>

<h3>A Lesson for Storytellers</h3>

<p>Grunwald shows what happens when all restraint breaks — when every noble, mercenary, and zealot throws himself into a single gamble. It is the kind of battle that ends <i>eras</i>, not just campaigns. And it is the reason most commanders, both real and fictional, <b>avoid battle whenever possible.</b></p>

<p>A full-scale clash like this is the <b>exception</b> — a storm that changes kingdoms, remembered for centuries precisely because no one dared repeat it.</p>

<h3>Use in Roleplay</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Treat it as a <b>historical event</b>, not a session encounter.</li>
  <li>Let the <b>aftermath</b> — famine, ransom, trauma, legend — shape the world far more than the clash itself.</li>
  <li>Make your players <i>feel</i> how rare and terrifying it is to see thousands on a single field, knowing one poor decision could doom a realm.</li>
