                Welcome to my personal website, a space where I share my worldbuilding and roleplaying projects. 
                Here, you'll also find a variety of resources designed to inspire and support your own creative endeavors. 
                <br><br>
                Feel free to draw inspiration from my work, as it’s the very same process that has fueled my own creations.
                <br><br>
                I believe that crafting imaginative worlds to explore with friends is far more rewarding than endlessly 
                scrolling through social media, so let's dive in and start creating!
                <br><br>
                As time goes on, this vault will grow and I will add a lot more content.
                <br><br>
                <h3>Regarding the World of Warcraft Lore on this Site:</h3>
                My projects play with custom lore, but always with the goal of staying true to Warcraft’s established setting. I don’t seek to rewrite major stories or alter canon events—instead, I try to fill in the blanks that Blizzard often leaves open.
                <br><br>
                That means adding detail to the small, everyday parts of Azeroth: how reagents and enchantments are applied, how a shipping company might realistically operate with wages and employees, or what kind of cuisine is served in different regions. 
                <br><br>
                These additions are meant to expand immersion and provide roleplayers with more tools, not to replace the game’s canon.
